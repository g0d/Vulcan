# Vulcan (Ver. 2.7)
Vulcan is a generalized, simple, fast and robust JS programming utilities library that assists in everyday problems during web development.

Vulcan is very straightforward, organized in namesspaces that make sense and provides a clean and concise paradigm. With Vulcan you can save a lot of time and avoid classic mistakes. Unlike other all-in-one, super "complete" and rather heavy libraries (like jQuery), Vulcan aims on providing a helping hand, a quick tool of sort, for the most frequent problems that you face under development.

Vulcan is a core library and part of the [micro-MVC](https://github.com/g0d/micro-MVC) framework.

For a minified version of the library, use this [link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/g0d/Vulcan@main/vulcan.min.js).
